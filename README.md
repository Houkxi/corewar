## Description

The challenge was to create a compiler named asm or ```Assembler```, to rewrite a ```Champion``` into a language understood by the virtual machine called ```Corewar```.
It was a four-person group project, the ```Assembler``` was done by [cfavero](https://github.com/cfavero) and [myself](https://github.com/mmanley42) and ```Corewar``` was completed by [mconti](https://github.com/m-conti) [tbehra]()

The ```Champion``` is written in assembly syntax and compiled by the ```Assembler``` into a specificaly parsed binary file. It will then be sent to the corewar programm where its bytecode will be loaded into the circular memory of the VM. From that point a process specific to a  ```Champion``` will go through that memory space and execute the commands it finds.
The idea from there is to have a face off between different strategies created for each ```Champions```.
